# __Mini-Mandala__

Color coded card game of skill and chance.

## __Game Outline__

The goal of mini-mandala is to get the high score. Play against the CPU by chosing one of four cards to play in the play field. The CPU will also play one of four colors to the play field. Play continues until all four colors are played. Then the players take turns picking a color and taking the corresponding cards.

Scoring will be counted by the amount of each color the players have, compared to their personal scoreboard. The order of the colors determines the value of that color for that player.
